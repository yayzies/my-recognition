**Sincere apologies, I am not able to finish this project due to lack of understanding in coding, and I tried my best but errors kept popping up and I don't have any idea of fixing it. I also lack the ability to completely write my own code so I don't think I should be submitting a project that I didn't fully create. I really did try my best, but being a complete beginner in coding was the biggest reason why I am unable to have a finished project. Thank you.**
